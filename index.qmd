I am currently a fifth-year PhD candidate in Biostatistics at the University of Michigan. I come from Mianyang, a beautiful city in Sichuan Province, China. 

I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Bhramar Mukherjee](https://ysph.yale.edu/profile/bhramar-mukherjee/) and [Dr. Xu Shi](http://www.xuritashi.com/). My dissertation focuses on developing statistical methods for analyzing electronic health records (EHR), with particular emphasis on addressing confounding, selection bias, and bias arising from clinically informative visiting processes.

In my free time, I enjoy playing squash, badminton, and table tennis.
